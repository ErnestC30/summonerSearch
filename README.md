# summonerSearch

**Introduction**</br>
This project is a website that mimics functionalities similar to op.gg and other League of Legends related profile lookup websites. 
Making use of the official Riot API, people can search a user's profile across different regions and get the stats from the user's most recent games. 
The website was created using React and was made to practice using a 3rd party API to collect data and then to display the data neatly using MaterialUI components. 
The project was also a practice exercise for me to introduce Typescript into my project for type checking.

The project currently supports six regions: North America, Brazil, Europe West, Europe North, Korea, and Japan, although it can be expanded to include each region supported by Riot.
